# react-dynamic-components
This isn't a complete project. This is the code for my Youtube video on how to load components based on values from arrays in React.

The same code is used for the video https://youtu.be/sU1rMZV3p3A where I demonstrate how to transition between different pages
and how to create forms https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-3ovwwpthw

The project here is very basic, I am using components from Material UI for React (https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui).
Material UI's icons are in fact components and in this project I load them dynamically from an array.
