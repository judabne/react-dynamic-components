# react-dynamic-components
This isn't a complete project. This is the code for my Youtube video on how to load components based on values from arrays in React.

The project here is very basic, I am using components from Material UI for React (https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui).
Material UI's icons are in fact components and in this project I load them dynamically from an array.
